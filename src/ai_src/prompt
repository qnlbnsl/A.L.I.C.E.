Audio streaming using python.
Has 2 sub applications: Client and Server
Server and Client code will be in different directories.
Directories will be called server and client respectively.
Each will have its own venv under their respective folders.
Both server and client connect using port 8080. They will define queues such that multiple clients an connect to the server.
Client captures audio from an 8 channel mic array at hw:1,0. 
The sample rate is 48000 and sample_width should be 2. We will stream 20ms audio chunks. 
Client then uses a multi processing queue to send the audio to the server.
audio is encoded using libopus.
The realtime nature off application requires that audio capture, processing, and sending all happen simultaneously. 
Server receives and decodes audio.
Server can support more than 1 audio streams at once.
Server uses a multi processing queue to send the audio to a process that uses whisper to convert the audio into text.
The nature of conversion should be realtime as well.
As audio streams in it will be transcribed.
Each Audio stream creates a new process that uses a transcribing module to convert the audio into text.
